I'm going to be expanding on my portfolio to show what I can do as I've always wanted to become a software developer, It's going to be a struggle as I don't have any qualifications in Computer Science or Data Science.

I'm going to learn online and learn the professional standers by watching courses online and tell myself I can do this.

I've always been told it's not about what you have it's about what you can do so I'm using this as motivation.
